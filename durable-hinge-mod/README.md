# Durable Hinge Mod
![](./Images/full-frame.png?raw=true)

## BOM:

* M3x50mm screws
* M3 heatserts
* M3x12mm screws
* M3x8mm screws
* M3x18mm screws (i think?)
* 6x3mm magnets

## Print:

I was lazy and didn't export any of the STLs in the right orientation but theres a way for everything to be printed without supports, save for the back hinge pieces. 
Place supports under the hinge cutout.
